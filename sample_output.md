# EXAMPLE DOCUMENT TITLE

This is a sample output showing how a PDF would be converted to Markdown format. The application preserves the original text structure and formatting from the PDF.

## Introduction

This converter extracts text directly from the PDF without using OCR on the text content. OCR is only applied to embedded images within the document.

### Features Overview

The following features are supported:
- Direct text extraction with formatting preservation
- Automatic heading detection
- Image extraction and OCR
- Markdown generation with proper structure

## Sample Image Section

Below is an example of how images are handled:

![Image](image_p1_1.png)

*Image text (OCR):* This text was extracted from the image using Tesseract OCR. If the image contains readable text like "Welcome to our service" or "Product specifications", it will appear here as a caption.

## Regular Paragraphs

Regular paragraphs from the PDF are extracted and formatted as standard Markdown text. Line breaks and spacing are preserved to maintain readability.

Multiple paragraphs are separated properly to ensure the output is clean and well-structured.

*Image text (OCR):* Another example of OCR text from a second image.

## Tables and Complex Content

While basic table structures in PDFs will be extracted as text, complex layouts may require manual adjustment. The converter does its best to maintain reading order by sorting content vertically.

## Conclusion

This sample demonstrates the typical output format. The actual output will depend on your PDF's content, structure, and the quality of embedded images for OCR processing.
